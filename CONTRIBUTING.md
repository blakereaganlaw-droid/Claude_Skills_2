# Contributing to this skills library

## The one rule
Every skill follows the house **"do + teach"** standard, which is defined in
[`coding-agent-skills:writing-agent-skills`](plugins/coding-agent-skills/skills/writing-agent-skills/SKILL.md).
Read it (or invoke `/coding-agent-skills:writing-agent-skills`) before adding or editing a skill.
Start any new skill by copying
[`SKILL.template.md`](plugins/coding-agent-skills/skills/writing-agent-skills/assets/SKILL.template.md).

## Quick reference
- A skill = `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (+ optional `references/`, `assets/`, `scripts/`).
- Frontmatter: `name` (== folder name, lowercase-hyphen, no `claude`/`anthropic`) and a third-person
  `description` (≤ 1024 chars) that states **what + when** and ends with `Triggers:`.
- Body sections, in order: `When to use` → `Do it` → `Why / learn` → `Common mistakes` →
  `Tailor to your environment` → `References` → (optional) `Scripts`. Keep the body under 500 lines.
- Evals go in `evals/<plugin>/<skill>.md` (positive trigger, near-miss, quality rubric) — never in SKILL.md.
- Validate with `bash scripts/validate.sh` and `claude plugin validate plugins/<plugin>`.

## Privacy
Never commit real client, bank, or account data. Sanitize to structural examples; keep raw
artifacts in `*.private.md` or `references/*.local.*` (git-ignored).

- **Wave 8 — Board of Advisors:** ✅ `board-of-advisors-skills`: the `board-review`
  orchestration skill plus six read-only subagents (performance, accuracy/correctness,
  structure/architecture, clarity/maintainability, robustness/edge-cases, board-chair) in
  the plugin's `agents/` folder.

Each plugin is independently installable and useful. Next: tailoring skills to your real
environment (Oracle OTBI reports, reconciliation process, chart of accounts, bank statement
formats) via each skill's `references/your-environment.md`.
