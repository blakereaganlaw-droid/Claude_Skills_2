# Treasury Analyst Skills

A growing personal library of [Claude Code Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
that make Claude a sharper partner for cash management, Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials and OTBI
reporting, accounting, banking, finance, business-intelligence analytics, practical data tooling,
statistics, machine learning, continuous improvement (Lean / TPS / Six Sigma / co-design), and
coding / autonomous agents.

Every skill is built to one house standard: it **does the task step by step and teaches the
reasoning**, so you get the deliverable *and* get better at the work.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add blakereaganlaw-droid/claude_skills_2
/plugin install cash-management-skills@treasury-analyst-skills
/plugin install oracle-otbi-skills@treasury-analyst-skills
# ...install whichever plugins you want
```

Installed skills are namespaced, e.g. `cash-management-skills:bank-reconciliation`. Type
`/<plugin>:<skill>` to invoke one directly, or just describe your task and Claude will pick it up.

**Full catalog:** [`docs/SKILLS.md`](docs/SKILLS.md) lists every skill, what it does, and the
exact phrases that trigger it (regenerate with `python3 scripts/gen-catalog.py`).

Skills are built in waves (day-job first). See the build status and design notes in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How it's built

- One repo that is both a **plugin marketplace** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) and the home
  for fifteen **plugins** under `plugins/`, mirroring Anthropic's own
  [`anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) layout.
- Two plugins also ship **subagents** in their `agents/` folders — after install they appear
  in `/agents` namespaced as `<plugin>:<name>`: the `board-of-advisors-skills` review swarm
  (orchestrated by the `board-review` skill) and
  `oracle-fusion-finance-skills:fusion-treasury-architect` (consulted by
  `fusion-architect-consult`).
- The authoring standard lives in the `coding-agent-skills:writing-agent-skills` skill; its
  template is `plugins/coding-agent-skills/skills/writing-agent-skills/assets/SKILL.template.md`.
- `bash scripts/validate.sh` lints every skill and manifest.

## Recommended companion marketplaces

These skills complement (and deliberately don't duplicate) two official marketplaces:

- [`anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) — install `document-skills` for
  polished .xlsx/.pdf/.docx/.pptx document *creation* (source-available, first-party), and
  `skill-creator`/`mcp-builder` for tooling. Our `data-tools-skills` covers the scripting side
  (pandas/openpyxl automation, extraction, local SQL) and points to the official document skills
  where they're the better fit.
- [`oracle/skills`](https://github.com/oracle/skills) — Oracle's official marketplace for
  Database, OCI, APEX, and GraalVM skills (`/plugin install db@oracle-skills`, etc.). Its
  `fusion` domain is still a stub, which is exactly the gap `oracle-fusion-finance-skills` and
  `oracle-otbi-skills` fill here.

## Tailoring to your environment

Many skills leave a `references/your-environment.md` hook so they can fit your real Oracle OTBI
reports, reconciliation process, chart of accounts, and bank statement formats. **Real data is
never committed** — sanitize it, and keep raw artifacts in `*.private.md` / `references/*.local.*`
files, which `.gitignore` keeps out of git.
