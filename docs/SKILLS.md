# Treasury Analyst Skills — trigger & capability catalog

Auto-generated from every skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter by `scripts/gen-catalog.py`. **95 skills across 15 plugins.**

## How to trigger a skill

There are two ways every skill fires:

1. **Automatically** — just describe your task in plain language. Claude matches your request against each skill's description and **trigger phrases** (listed below) and loads the right one on its own. You don't need to name it.

2. **Manually** — type the slash command `/{plugin}:{skill}` (e.g. `/cash-management-skills:bank-reconciliation`) to invoke a specific skill on demand.

Ask **"what skills are available?"** any time to list them.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add blakereaganlaw-droid/claude_skills_2
/plugin install <plugin>@treasury-analyst-skills      # e.g. cash-management-skills@treasury-analyst-skills
```
Install only the plugins you want; each is independent. Skills are namespaced `<plugin>:<skill>` so they never collide.

**What it does:** Explains the Uniform Guidance standards for charging personnel costs to federal awards (§200.430) — reasonable compensation, consistent institutional policy, records that accurately reflect total work activity and support salary distribution, budget estimates adjusted to actuals — and why unsupported effort turns into questioned costs that claw back previously billed AR. Use for questions about salary charges, effort reporting, payroll allocation, effort certification, or when federal project data shows high personnel-cost density.
